* Arxiv Update

This is a simple script to view the daily updates from arXiv. We can
set up a cron job to automate this process.

** Files and Structure
- In ~fields.org~, we write some keywords for the queries.
- In ~authors.org~, we list the names of the authors.

** Preparation
Create a directory named =papers= beforehand.
